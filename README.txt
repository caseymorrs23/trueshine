# TrueShine Cleaning Services Website

## What’s included
- `index.html` (single-page conversion-focused site)
- `thank-you.html` (FormSubmit redirect page)
- Sticky header + mobile hamburger menu + floating mobile CTA
- FormSubmit wired to: tr600138@gmail.com
- SEO basics: meta description, Open Graph, JSON-LD LocalBusiness, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`

## Important edits before going live
1. Replace `https://example.com/` with your real domain:
   - `index.html`: canonical URL + JSON-LD `url` and `image` URLs
   - `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`
   - FormSubmit `_next` URL (redirect after submit)
2. Update service area list and add your exact business address if you want it indexed.
3. Replace placeholder reviews with real testimonials (name/initials + city).
4. Add real before/after photos (optimize/compress for speed).

## Deploy
Upload the folder contents to your hosting (GoDaddy, GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.).
